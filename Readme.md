A small package to extend scipy.stats to work with empirical CDFs, peaked CDFs, and also create interpolated (compressed) versions of possibly large empirical cumulative distributions functions.

Have a look at the included jupyter notebooks in the docs directory for usage examples.

More about peaked CDFs can be found in [Berg and Harris 2008](https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.3852).
